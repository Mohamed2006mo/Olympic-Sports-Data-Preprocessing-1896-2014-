# Olympic Sports Data Preprocessing (1896–2014)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning and preprocessing Olympic sports data** from 1896 to 2014. The main goal is to transform the raw data into a **structured, analysis-ready dataset** that can be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, or machine learning.

## 📂 Data
The dataset contains information on:
- **Year** – Year of the Olympic Games  
- **Sport/Event** – Name of the sport or event  
- **Country** – Participating countries  
- **Athlete** – Names of the athletes  
- **Medal** – Type of medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze)  

**Raw data** may contain missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries, which are cleaned in this project.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps
1. **Cleaning**
   - Handle missing or incomplete data  
   - Standardize country and event names  
   - Remove duplicates  

2. **Transformation**
   - Convert data types (e.g., year as integer)  
   - Aggregate or pivot tables for analysis (e.g., medals by country/year)  

3. **Validation**
   - Check data consistency  
   - Generate summary statistics to verify cleaning
